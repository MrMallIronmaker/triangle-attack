===============

Attack of the Triangles is a tower defense game built in Python and Pygame during a twelve-hour hackathon.

To execute, both Python and pygame are required dependencies.
It has most recently been built using Python 2.7 and pygame 1.9.1.

Run main.py and everything should work from there. Drop off a comment if you run into any problems.

A binary executable will be available shortly.
