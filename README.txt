STORY:

In the year 2114, American computer scientists have designed a program for the military to simulate the function of deadly, cutting-edge arc towers for the country's border defense.  With these towers, the American people would be safe and sound forever, but terror struck when Chinese hackers broke into the computer simulation and spread the deadly Tri.ANGLE virus through it.  The Tri.ANGLE virus is spreading through the military and government servers, onwards to the President's computer.  Your job, agent, is to counter-hack through the system and eradicate the Tri.ANGLE virus using hacked simulation arc towers.  The fate of America depends on you, agent. Save the nation before it's too late!

HOW TO PLAY:

Use your mouse to click on a tower listed at the bottom of the screen, ten click on a bright-green title to place the selected tower there.

The GREEN tower is the BEAM tower, which burst-fires a powerful beam to a single Tri.ANGLE virus. (Good for small mobs, bad for large mobs)

The WHITE tower is the RECHARGE tower which increased the range and damage of nearby towers. (Good for supporting a cluster of towers)

The BLUE tower is the LIGHTNING tower, while fires off a lightning bolt to ALL nearby Tri.ANGLE viruses. (Good for large mobs and supporting the beam tower, bad on its own)

Placing towers costs resources, so manage your resources wisely!
(You DON'T get rewarded resources at the end of the level, as the governemnt is currently short of funds!)

Prevent the Tri.ANGLE viral invasion from reaching the end of the pathway.

Good luck, agent.
